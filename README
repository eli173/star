Implementation of *Star (http://ea.ea.home.mindspring.com/*Star.html) as a web app, in a play-by-mail style

Uses Flask as the web framework, SQLite3 for the database, and HTML/SVG for the rest (no javascript!)

If you plan on using this, you should almost definitely change the app.secret_key to something that's not in a public git repository

Includes sample database in db.db, with users asdf and qwer with passwords fdsa and rewq, respectively, for you to play with
You can set up an empty database by removing that file and running ```sqlite3 db_name < schema.sql'''


The code included could use a thorough cleaning; more encapsulated database references, use classes better etc.
Taking care of this is probably what's next unless something is broken or some feature is requested
